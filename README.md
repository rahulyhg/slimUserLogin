# slimUserLogin

This is an exercise to build a User Login Demo based on Slim Framework version 3

This root Folder contains the docker-compose configuration

To run this Demo you should use docker from https://www.docker.com/
Use "docker-compose up -d" to start the containers.

You should be able to use the demo software at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
PhpMyAdmin should also be runnig on port 8090 at http://127.0.0.1:8090/

Note that development was done on OSX and no tests have been run on Windows or Linux to check if Docker configuration is ok on these platforms
